Deadpool Total Package
This is my final Python project. I created a multi-tool script that helps with privacy and gathering information. I called it the "Deadpool Total Package" because it’s a little chaotic but gets the job done.

Here is what the program can do:

1. Deadpool’s File Scrambler (Encryption)
This tool takes normal text and scrambles it using a substitution cipher so nobody else can read it.

Encrypt & Decrypt: You can turn text into a secret code and turn it back again.

Three Ways to Use It:

Manual: You just type the text right into the window.

Demo: Use the built-in test sentences I wrote.

File Mode: You can give it the path to a text file on your computer. It will create a NEW file with the scrambled text (so you don't lose the original).

Safety First: I added a preview so you can see if it worked before you save it.

2. Password Generator
This makes strong, random passwords so you don't get hacked.

You choose how long the password is (minimum 8 characters).

You can choose to include uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

It lets you save the password to a file called pass.txt.

3. OSINT Scanner (Target Recon)
This feature helps you find information on a "target."

File Scanner: It looks through a text file (or my internal demo data) and pulls out all the email addresses and phone numbers it finds.

Social Media Search: You type in a name, and it automatically opens a Google search for that person on LinkedIn, Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

How to Run It
Make sure you have Python installed.

Run the script DeadpoolTotalPackage.py.

Use the menu to pick what you want to do (type 1, 2, 3, or 4).

Note: The script creates files in the same folder where the script is saved. It will always ask you before overwriting a file, so it is safe to use.

Maximum effort!
